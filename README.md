# Investigraph

**AI-Powered Investigations. Faster. Multilingual. Connected.**  
Investigraph is a **beta research project** exploring how AI and knowledge graphs accelerate investigations for institutions and independent researchers.

## What it does

- **Ingest large corpora** â€” Emails, PDFs, reports, web archives. Preserves source links and document provenance.  
- **Multilingual extraction** â€” Detects languages and pulls **people, organisations, accounts, locations, dates, communications, transactions**.  
- **Cross-document linking** â€” Merges entities across languages and builds a **graph of nodes and edges** with link-strength scores.  
- **Relevance & triage** â€” Ranks documents, snippets, and entities so analysts jump to the most promising evidence first.  
- **Graph-first navigation** â€” Pivot by person, company, address or event; jump from a node to every related message, file and actor.  
- **Evidence packs** â€” Bookmark nodes/snippets into a case notebook you can export or share for peer review.

> **Field note (public datasets):** classic keyword-only workflows can take **weeksâ€“months** to assemble usable evidence across large corpora. With Investigraph, the same analyst can compile a **richer evidence set in a few hours**, often surfacing **~10Ã— more cross-document links**. Results vary by dataset and methodology; this is **not a guarantee**.

## Who it's for (use cases)

- **Banking â€” Financial Crime & AML**: round-tripping, layered transfers, shell entities, insider collusion.  
- **Insurance â€” Claims & Network Risk**: link claimants, addresses, service providers, phones/emails to detect repeat patterns and ring behaviour.  
- **Internal Audit & Public Sector Oversight**: connect procurement, correspondence and reports to flag conflicts, bid patterns and anomalies.  
- **Legal / e-Discovery / Forensic Consulting**: faster issue spotting, chronology building and witness/entity maps.  
- **Citizen Journalism & Public Research (OSINT)**: scale archival work (e.g., Enron, JFK release) and publish transparent, navigable graphs.

## Status & roadmap

- **Status:** Beta research project.  
- **Directions weâ€™re exploring:**  
  - **Institutions:** limited pilots and **on-prem / private-cloud** deployments.  
  - **Independent researchers:** a future **SaaS** offering (waitlist via the website).

---

## Data & security

- Public demos only; we donâ€™t accept uploads from the site during beta.  
- Minimal, cookie-free analytics (e.g., Plausible) to understand interest.  
- For pilots, the design goal is to run in controlled environments where data stays within the organisationâ€™s infrastructure.
